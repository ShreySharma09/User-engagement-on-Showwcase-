# User-engagement-on-Showwcase-
1.1 Background
Showwcase is an online platform where members of the tech community connect, share their knowledge, work experiences, projects built, people they've worked with - and find new opportunities. Showwcase users can like, follow, comment, and share posts on the platform. The company's goal is to build a platform that encourages users to share, exchange ideas, connect, and learn from other users. Every time a user logs into their Showwcase account, a new session begins. In each session, we track how and where a user is engaged on the platform.

1.2 Challenge
To better understand "user engagement" on Showwcase platform for the month of October 2019.
